These files are shared for the purpose of helping medical professionals treat COVID-19 patients by splitting the output and input from a single ventilator among multiple patients. This was designed to replace the network of tubes and tees that some hospitals are using to accomplish this. It does not include any filtration or valving, but is designed to have clearance for 90mm diameter filters. The inlet is a 22mm female socket, and the 4 outlets are 22mm spigot connections. This is an EXPERIMENTAL design which has NOT BEEN TESTED ON HUMANS.

It is designed to be printed in PETG on an FDM 3D printer. On a Prusa i3 M3S it prints in about 3:30, using 0.3mm layer height and no supports. It should also be printable on SLA and MSLA machines with sufficient build volume.

As of 3/21/2020, this has been tested for dimensional accuracy on a Prusa i3 Mk3S and printability. This will be updated.
On 3/22/2020, I added a 2 way splitter for ventilators which cannot support 4. I also added some Male-Male and Male-Female adapters so standard ½” pipe (PVC, copper), can be used. These are friction fit as of now, but PVC could be glued.
On 3/24/2020 received confirmation that it fits on ventilators at Albany Medical College.
